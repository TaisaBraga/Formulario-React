# Mentoria Globant

This project serves as a comprehensive example for mentoring sessions focused on React development. It was built with the intention of illustrating core concepts, including:

- Component-Based Architecture: Understanding how to break down a UI into reusable components.
- State Management: Learning how to manage and update data within a React application.
- Form Handling: Implementing forms, handling user input, and validating data.
- Modern Development Workflow: Utilizing Vite for a fast and efficient development experience.

This project is designed to be a hands-on learning resource. The code is thoroughly documented, making it easy for mentees to follow along and understand the reasoning behind each decision. It's intended to be used as a reference, allowing mentees to explore, experiment, and solidify their understanding of React.
